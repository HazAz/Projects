Ian Benlolo, Hyunji Lee, David Edward and I worked on this project in the McGill Physics Hackathon.
The goal of this project was to map out and animate the results of releasing small particles into a buble chamber, in an attempt to find out how different sized and charged particles move at different speeds and radii.
